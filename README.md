  🎮 Gamer at heart.  
  👾 Dev by curiosity.  
  💻 I build random tools, test them on myself, break them, then do it again for fun.

## 🕹️ What I Do (besides rage quit at 3AM)

- 👨‍💻 I don’t build games, I break them... and then make tools to fix what I broke  
- ⚙️ Love scripting weird utilities just to avoid 3 clicks  
- 🧪 I test everything on myself because QA hates me  
- 🛠️ I build tools nobody asked for, then flex them like I built Skyrim  
- 🎮 If it runs in a terminal and can crash gloriously, I probably made it

## 🧠 Currently Obsessing Over

- 🧩 Automating my own chaos  
- 🧼 Refactoring mess I swore was “temporary” six months ago  
- ⚡ Turning dumb ideas into working scripts... accidentally  
- 🧠 Dev tools I wish existed (so I make my own and forget I made them)

## 🔥 Random Facts About Me

- I once built a script to mute my mic when I rage (it failed)  
- My repo is 50% tools, 50% regrets  
- My variables are named like: `chicken`, `banana`, `boom`, and I stand by it  
- I don't have bugs. I have "interactive features"
