  👾 People call me Naz.<br>
  🎮 I make games, break stuff, automate boring things, and pretend it was intentional.<br>
  ☕ Fueled by caffeine, bugs, and good intentions.

## 🕹️ What I Do (besides crash game engines at 2AM)

- 👨‍💻 Full-time dev, part-time chaos wizard  
- 🎮 Indie Game Developer — mostly Lua, Unity, and FiveM mods that "kinda work"  
- 🤖 I automate daily stuff... so I can break it faster  
- 📦 Build tools nobody asked for, but now I can’t live without  
- 🧪 Learn by failing gloriously, then acting like that was the plan all along 😌  

---

## 🧠 Currently Obsessing Over

- ✨ Writing modular backend scripts like a grown-up (sometimes)  
- ⚡ Building CLI tools that make me feel like I’m in a cyberpunk anime  
- 🔄 Debugging past me’s code and sending hate mail to myself  
- 📚 Reading docs I’ll ignore later anyway
